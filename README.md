# Intelligent-Policing
Empowering Police forces through Data Analytics.

**Objective of the proposed research**
The mission of our startup company 'NightWatch' is modernize the policing through use of cutting edge technologies. Our vision is to empower various law enforcement agencies across our nation with actionable insights by analysing crime data from year 1975 to 2015 across various states. Our motto is 'Safer places leads to happy communities which inturn leads to economic prosperity'.

We will analyse various crime data statistics such as violent crimes, homicides, rapes, assaults, robberies, etc for various years from 1975 to 2015 and compare it with the population statistics of each state to comeup with which states rank top and bottom in different crime types across state police jurisdictions.

The aim here is to provide advanced solutions to various law enforcement agencies to look at trends and crime patterns for effective use of policing resources for maximum effectiveness. With the help of analyses we aim to reduce the crime rates by revisiting important policing resource deployments and policies for effective usage.
